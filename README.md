Hey there!<br>
I'm Aylin, a sophomore @ FSW.<br>
I design and build projects that create meaningful, real-world impact.<br>
My main tech stack is Javascript, html and css. My favorite tool right now is figma.<br>
I’m locking in and building more projects that you’ll get to see soon.<br>
Fun Facts:<br>
• I love matcha
• I don't like pickles
• I love k-dramas
• Hobbies: journaling, gym, building things<br>
